Time spent: 12 hours

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
 * [x] Required: The menu can look similar to the LinkedIn menu below or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
 * [x] Required: Contains the user header view
 * [x] Required: Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers

Notes:

I spent a bit of time refactoring previous code to make it easier to integrate.
